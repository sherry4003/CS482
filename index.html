    <h2>Gaussain filter</h2>
      <p>This project uses the gausian filter apply to images. </p>
      <p>First of all, we need to loads an image with a size 512x512 in color or black.</p>
      <p>This can be done by the function cv2.GaussianBlur(). Before applying this function we need to find out the width and height of the kernel which should be positive and odd. We are using sigma = 1 ,2 ,3 respectively with the standard deviation in X and Y directions. The purpose of the Gaussain blur is to reduce or remove  gaussian noise from the image. </p>
      <p>Also it applies with cv2.Sobel() to find the derivative of the image</p>
      <p>The images bellow will show the result of the functions</p>
